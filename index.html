		<p><i>Kimitake Hiraoka</i>, better known as <i>Yukio Mishima</i>, was a japanese writer and playwright born in 1925. His first (published) novel, <cite>Confessions of a Mask</cite>, was his first success after a history of writing stories since an early age. He stood out for his extravagance and peculiar style that merged dark, often dramatic themes with a subtle and delicate writing style, known for his exacerbation of Japan's traditional values.</p>
		<p id="paragraph">Nominated to the Nobel Prize of Literature in 1968, Mishima gave to the world several novels, plays and stories that combined topics such as beauty, death and traditionalism, with a critique of modern society. His tetralogy, <cite>The Sea of Fertility</cite>, is the best example of this critique, being composed of 4 novels detailing the <em>"fall"</em> of modern Japan.<br>
		Mishima killed himself the 25 of November of 1970,  in what is known as <i>seppuku</i> or ritual suicide, after a failed coup d'etat, an act considered by many to be a final protest against the decadent and mordern Japan.</p> <hr>
